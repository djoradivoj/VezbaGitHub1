    <p>Exercise helps you to lose weight while keeping your muscles strong, which helps protect the joints and makes it easier to move around. So overweight and obese people with osteoarthritis should find ways to lose weight that include exercise aimed at increasing their muscle strength and enhancing their mobility.

Eating certain foods can also help improve patients’ symptoms and reduce their daily joint pain. Evidence shows eating more oily fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines, can improve pain and function in arthritis. This is because the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids they contain reduce the amount of inflammatory substances the body produces. Fish oil supplements of 1.5g per day may also help.

But eating fish oils alone may not be enough. It is also important to reduce the long-term consumption of fatty red meats and replace saturated animal fats with vegetable oils, such as olive and rapeseed.Osteoarthritis patients are more likely to have raised blood cholesterol, so eating in a way that reduces blood cholesterol can help, as well as improving general cardiovascular health. Reducing the amount of saturated fat you eat and increasing the amount of oats and other soluble fibres will help to reduce cholesterol.

Other specific ways to reduce blood cholesterol include eating 30g a day of nuts, 25g a day of soy protein from tofu, soy milk or soy beans, and eating 2g a day of substances called stanols and sterols. These are found in small amounts in plants but the easiest way to consume them is in fortified drinks, spreads and yoghurts that have these substances added to them.

Osteoarthritis occurs when the joints become inflamed by increased amounts of oxygen-containing reactive chemicals in the body. This means that eating more antioxidants, which can neutralise these chemicals, should protect the joints.

Vitamins A, C and E are potent antioxidants and you should make sure you get the guideline amounts of them to maintain healthy connective tissues throughout the body. However, the evidence that they improve osteoarthritis symptoms is debatable</p>

    <p>When it comes to the world of exercise, no debate is as contentious as cardio vs strength training.

While some fitness aficionados will happily endure hour-long slogs on the treadmill, others will turn their noses up at anything cardiovascular, choosing instead to spend their workout time lifting heavy weights and ‘getting their pump on’.

As for which form of training is superior, there is no clear winner as this largely depends on your fitness goals and basic preferences.

Eating greens and doing cardio is not the way to get lean, says PT
However, despite claims that strength training burns more calories than its cardio counterpart, a new study has revealed that cardio training may offer more benefits in terms of metabolism.

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen examined the differences between levels of hormone production after a group of participants completed both strength training and weight training programmes to see how they compared.

Published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight, the study involved 10 healthy young men who were divided into two groups, completing either strength or weight training once a week.

Those doing cardio completed their exercise on a bicycle while those doing strength training did a weights-based programme consisting of five exercises, each of which had to be repeated 10 times, designed to work each of the major muscle groups such as the chest, biceps, triceps and quads.

After completing the workouts, which lasted 60 minutes each, blood samples were taken over a four-hour period to measure participants' levels of lactic acid, bile, blood sugar and the different levels of hormones in their body.

The analysis revealed that those who had been cycling experienced a significant increase in the production of the hormone FGF21, which offers numerous positive effects on one’s metabolism, the process by which our body converts food into energy.

Boosting one's metabolic rate can be beneficial because the higher your metabolism, the more calories you burn at rest, which can help promote weight loss.</p>

    <p>The accumulation of mutated stem cells in bone marrow has been identified as a major new risk factor for heart disease, according to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This process, called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (Chip) helps to explain why older people are more likely to have heart attacks.

Ageing increases the risk of heart disease partly due to a lifetime’s worth of exposure to risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking and obesity. But many people who don’t have these risk factors still suffer heart attacks. When exposure to these factors is accounted for, ageing remains a strong predictor of heart disease.

Chip describes a number of mutations that seem to accumulate in a specific group of genes that are associated with inflammation and cancer. The Chip mutations are somatic – meaning they can’t be inherited – and are picked up randomly over time in hematopoietic stem cells, a type of adult stem cell in the bone marrow that continually produces new blood cells.Somatic mutations occur naturally, but damaging stimuli, such as fat and cigarette smoke, can cause them to occur more frequently. Most of the time these mutations have no effect.

Sometimes, if a mutation occurs in a specific gene, it can give the mutated cell a competitive advantage. This leads to the expansion of the population of cells carrying the mutation – essentially, natural selection at the cellular level. In Chip this means a small number of founder cells can effectively take over and generate most of the cells in a person’s blood.Researchers in the new study sequenced the DNA from blood cells to detect Chip in 4,726 people with heart disease and 3,529 healthy controls. People with Chip mutations were found to have almost double the risk of heart disease, compared with people without the mutation. In younger people with Chip the risk of heart disease was four times higher.

 To test whether Chip might actually cause disease, the authors went on to investigate possible mechanisms that could explain if Chip might cause heart disease.</p>
